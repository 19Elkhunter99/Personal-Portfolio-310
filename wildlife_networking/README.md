 Wildlife Sighting Reporter – Idaho Edition

 Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate how Python and socket programming can be used to build a functional client-server application. As a software engineer, my goal is to deepen my understanding of real-world networking workflows—especially handling multiple connections, transmitting structured data, and simulating real-time systems. I also want to show others how learning the basics of networking can lead to practical and meaningful software.

Demo Video

[Here is my demo video link](https://youtu.be/_wPD7fD-2Mg)

The video includes:
- A walkthrough of the Wildlife Sighting Reporter system
- How clients submit species, location, and time data
- How the server receives and logs sightings in real time
- Commentary on socket setup, threading, and communication logic

 Development Environment

- Python 3.13.5
- Visual Studio Code 
- Git
- Windows 11

 Useful Websites

These resources were helpful during development:

* [Python socket documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)
* [Real Python – Socket Programming](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/)
* [Python threading guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)
* [VS Code Python Setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

 Learning Strategy

I used incremental development and frequent testing to build the client and server step-by-step. When I encountered connection errors or threading issues, I debugged methodically and simplified the protocol. I practiced using Git for version control and published the final version to a public HTTPS GitHub repository. I focused on making the code beginner-friendly with clear comments and modular structure.
